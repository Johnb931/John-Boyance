With a recent graduation from TripleTen, I am eager to apply my analytical skills and business acumen to drive data-informed decisions in the business analytics realm. I enjoy working with numbers, uncovering trends, and turning insights into actionable strategies that help organizations grow.

Outside of work, I love being outdoors and staying activeâ€”whether it's hiking, playing sports, or exploring new places. My goal for 2025 is to land a role where I can blend my passion for analytics with my drive to make a meaningful impact.

Always open to connecting with like-minded professionals and exploring new opportunities in business analytics!</p><p align='left'> You can view my resume <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gFd9-yJRJxkJzM8MmC8JprQZ33bXniM7esP6fIqwVds/edit?usp=sharing ' target=_blank><u>here</u>.</a></p>
